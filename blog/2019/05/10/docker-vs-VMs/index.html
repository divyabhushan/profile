Updating a patch on various machines from a single virtualized server is much more feasible.</li><li><strong>Disaster recovery</strong>: Since all the virtualized machines reside on the same server and are treated as mounted volumes of data files, it is easier to back up these machines. In case of a disaster failure (power failure, network down, cyber-attacks, failed test code, etc) VM screenshots are used to recover the running state of the machine and the whole setup can be built up within minutes.</li><li><strong>Isolated and independent secure test environment</strong>: virtualization provide an isolated independent virtual test environment to test the legacy code or a vendor-specific product or even a beta release or say a corrupt code without affecting the main hardware and software platform. (This is a contradictory statement though; will discuss more under types of virtualization)<br>These test environments like dev, uat, preprod, prod etc..can be easily tested and discarded.</li><li><strong>Easily scalable and upgradable</strong>: Building up more simulated environments means spinning up more virtual machines. Also upgrading VMs is as good as to run a patch in all VMs.</li><li><strong>Portable</strong>: Virtual machines are lightweight compared to the actual running physical machines; in addition, a VM that includes its own OS, drivers, and other installation files is portable on any machine.

Each VM has its own copy of OS.</td><td>Software level virtualization. Dockers have no own OS, run on host OS</td></tr><tr><td>Isolation</td><td>Fully isolated</td><td>Process or application-level isolation.</td></tr><tr><td>Installation</td><td>Hypervisor can run directly on the hardware resources or on the host OS.</td><td>Docker engine is installed on top of the host OS. A docker daemon process is initiated on the host OS. There is no separate OS for every container.</td></tr><tr><td>CPU processing + performance</td><td>Slower: A VM contains the entire run-time environment that has to be loaded every time. Uses more CPU cycles; gives unstable performance.</td><td>Faster: Docker images are pre-built and share host resources as a result running an image as a container is lightweight and consumes less CPU cycle; gives a stable performance</td></tr><tr><td>Hardware storage</td><td>More storage space as each VM is an independent machine (OS). Example: 3 VMs of 800MB each will take 2.4 GB of space.</td><td>Docker containers are lightweight since do not require to load OS+drivers, run on host OS as processes.</td></tr><tr><td>Portable</td><td>Dependency on host OS and hardware makes VM less portable. Importing a VM still requires manual setup such storage, RAM and network.</td><td>Highly portable since lightweight and zero dependency on hardware.</td></tr><tr><td>Scalable and code-reusability</td><td>Spinning up more VMs still need administrative tasks such as distributing resources to VM. Running a new machine puts extra load on the system resources also re-managing earlier VMs becomes a task. Every VM keeps its own copy of resources-poor code-reusability.</td><td>Spinning up new docker containers simply means running pre-built images into containers as a process inside host OS. Containers are also configured on-the-fly passing parameters and run-time. Single image can be run and used to create many containers; encourage code-reusability</td></tr><tr><td>Resource utilization</td><td>Static allocation results in resource wastage in case of idle VMs or if a VMâs resource requirement increases.</td><td>Resources are dynamically allocated and de-allocated on the need basis by the docker engine.</td></tr><tr><td>Docker system prune or garbage collection</td><td>Virtual machines do not have an in-built prune mechanism, these have to be administered manually.</td><td>Docker image and containers can be pruned; which frees up a sensible amount of storage and memory space and CPU cycles.</td></tr><tr><td>New environment</td><td>Creating new VM from the scratch is a tedious, repetitive tasks. It involves installing a new OS, loading kernel drivers and other tools and configurations.</td><td>Package the code and dependency files, build into an image, run the image to create a new container. Use an existing or a base image (dockerhub- scratch) to run and create more containers on the go.</td></tr><tr><td>Web-hosted Hub</td><td>No web hosted hub for VMs</td><td>dockerHub provides an open-source reliable trusted source of pre-built images that can be downloaded to run new containers.</td></tr><tr><td>Version control (backup, restore,track history)(refer git)</td><td>Snapshot of VMs are not very user-friendly and consume more space.</td><td>Docker images are version controlled.Â Every delta difference in each docker container can easily be viewed (demo: docker diff ).Â Any change in the image is stored as a different layered version. A reference link to older images saves build time and space.</td></tr><tr><td>Auto-build</td><td>Automation of creating VMs is not very feasible.</td><td>Docker images can also be auto-built from every source code check-in to GitHub (Automated builds on Dockerhub)</td></tr><tr><td>Disaster recovery</td><td>Tedious to recover from VM backup files.</td><td>Easier to restore docker images (like files) just like git source files in case images are version controlled. Backup images only have to be run to create containers. (refer: screenshot).</td></tr><tr><td>Update</td><td>All the VMs have to updated with the release patch.</td><td>A single image is updated, re-built and distributed across multiple platforms.</td></tr><tr><td>Memory usage+speed</td><td>Slower: Entire snapshot of a machine and the OS is loaded into the cache memory.</td><td>Real-time and fast: pre-built images. Only the instance, i.e, a container has to be run as a process and uses memory like an executable</td></tr><tr><td>Data integrity</td><td>VM behavior may change if the dependency includes beyond the VM boundaries. (example: an app depends on production host network settings)</td><td>Same behavior of apps in any environment</td></tr><tr><td>security</td><td>More secure: A failure inside a VM may reach its guest OS but not the host OS or other virtual machines. Type-2 hypervisor though has a risk of kernel attack.</td><td>Less secure: If a docker container compromised; underlying OS and hence all the containers may be affected since they share the same host kernel. OS Kernel may also be risked.</td></tr><tr><td>Key providers</td><td>Red hat KVM, VMWare, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Mircrosoft Hyper-V, Citrix XenServer</td><td>Dockers,Â Google kubernetes Engine,Â AWS Elastic Container service</td></tr><tr><td>Data authentication</td><td>Lot of software licenses.</td><td>Docker maintains inbuilt content trust to verify published images.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="when-to-use-vm-or-a-docker"></a><em>When to use VM or a Docker</em><a class="hash-link" href="#when-to-use-vm-or-a-docker" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When the need is an isolated OS, go for VMs.</p><p>For a hardware and software independent isolated application that needs fast distribution on multiple environments, use dockers.</p><ul><li><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="docker-use-case"></a>Docker use-case:<a class="hash-link" href="#docker-use-case" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></li></ul><p>Example: A database application along with its database</p><p>Consider the docker image - <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-weblogic-server-12c?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle WebLogic Server</a> on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker Hub</a>.</p><p>This image is pre-built Oracle WebLogic Server runtime environment, including Oracle Linux 7 and Oracle JDK 8 for deploying Java EE applications.</p><p>To create Server configurations on any machine, just download this image and run to create and start a container.</p><p>There is no need to install and configure JDK, Linux or other run-time environment.</p><ul><li><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="do-not-use-docker-use-case"></a>Do not use Docker use-case:<a class="hash-link" href="#do-not-use-docker-use-case" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></li></ul><p>The application depends on utility outside the docker container.</p><p>Code developed on dev machine with base OS as MAC; needs certain firewall setting on say Ubuntu OS.</p><p>How can the code be tested on the production ubuntu OS firewall while running from MAC OS docker container?</p><p>Solution:  Install a virtualization software on host OS-MAC; Create a VM (Virtual machine) with host OS as Ubuntu (same as production environment).</p><p>Configure the desired firewall settings on host VM â Ubuntu; import the test code inside Ubuntu and test.</p><ul><li><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="use-a-vm"></a>Use a VM:<a class="hash-link" href="#use-a-vm" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></li></ul><p>For Embedded systems programming, a VM is installed that connects to the system device drivers, controllers and kernel.</p><ul><li><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="virtualization-used-along-with-docker"></a>Virtualization used along with docker:<a class="hash-link" href="#virtualization-used-along-with-docker" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></li></ul><p>An extension to the previous scenario would be if you would want to also test your python application in the host OS-Ubuntu VM without having to set up the python exe and its libraries and binaries.</p><p>All you have to do is: Install <a href="https://www.knowledgehut.com/devops/docker-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> engine for Ubuntu OS and pull the python image from Docker hub as:</p><p>docker pull python:tag [ tag is the python version-choose the appropriate version ]</p><p>docker pull python:2.7</p><p>Refer: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python image</a></p><p>Either write a Dockerfile to import/copy entire source code to python environment or directly run the image passing the script path as below:</p><p>Command:</p><p>$docker run -it --name my-python-script -v â$PWDâ:/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp python:2.7 python my-application.py</p><p>Command options:</p><p>-v = volume list-bind mount a volume [mount present working directory onto /usr/src/myapp inside container]</p><p>-w = workdir string-working directory inside the container</p><p>Moreover; you can also test your python code in more than one version by downloading different python images, running them to create different containers and running your app in each container.</p><p>Whatâs exciting here is that once the code tested in each python environment; you could quickly work on the test results and drop the containers.
